Dear reader,
You are encountering a university project developed for Philips Museum Eindhoven by My Tran, Floris van Warmerdam, Jort Wiersma, and Euwe de Wilde.
A version of this project will be displayed in the Philips Museum in 2024. For the project, we make use of different AI's and we cannot claim rights to the outputs, nor to the AI's used.
We are very passionate about our work, and hope you like it!
You can contact us at j.wiersma@student.tue.nl, e.a.d.wilde@student.tue.nl or our teacher at y.chuang@tue.nl

In order to use the project without Arduino for serial communication, use the noserial.py file. Use your own openai api key. In order to create the required files, please work through the commands 0 - 3 chronologically.
The terminal does not provide information as to what commands do, so please refer to the main loop towards the end of the python code. After having created all required files (such as webcam_capture.jpg), the code commands can be used in any order as the previous image will be used.
